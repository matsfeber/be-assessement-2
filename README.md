## Meeting50+
Meeting50+ is a datingsite for people above the age of 50. Instead of matching people on appearance and interests you can create 'activitys'. When you see an activity you would like to do you can message the person that created the activity (messaging is not working yet)

The site is in dutch.

### Screens
The first screen lets you log-in or if you dont have an account yet, sign-up.
